        The Open Source Project Security (OSPS) Baseline is a set of security
        criteria that projects should meet to demonstrate a strong security posture.
        This baseline is based on the NIST SP 800-218 and the OpenSSF Best Practices
        Badge Program. The controls are organized by maturity level and category. In
        the detailed subsections you will find the control, rationale, and notes.

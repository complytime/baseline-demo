    title: OpenSSF Best Practices Badge
    version: "2024"
    description: The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Best Practices Badge is a way for Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects to show that they follow best practices. Projects can voluntarily self-certify, at no cost, by using this web application to explain how they follow each best practice. The OpenSSF Best Practices Badge is inspired by the many badges available to projects on GitHub. Consumers of the badge can quickly assess which FLOSS projects are following best practices and, as a result, are more likely to produce higher-quality secure software.

    title: NIST Cybersecurity Framework
    version: "2"
    description: The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 provides guidance to industry, government agencies, and other organizations to manage cybersecurity risks. It offers a taxonomy of high level cybersecurity outcomes that can be used by any organization — regardless of its size, sector, or maturity — to better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity efforts. The CSF does not prescribe how outcomes should be achieved. Rather, it links to online resources that provide additional guidance on practices and controls that could be used to achieve those outcomes.

    title: Secure Software Development Framework
    version: "1.1"
    description: The Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) is a set of fundamental, sound, and secure software development practices based on established secure software development practice documents from organizations such as BSA, OWASP, and SAFECode. Few software development life cycle (SDLC) models explicitly address software security in detail, so practices like those in the SSDF need to be added to and integrated with each SDLC implementation. Following the SSDF practices should help software producers reduce the number of vulnerabilities in released software, reduce the potential impact of the exploitation of undetected or unaddressed vulnerabilities, and address the root causes of vulnerabilities to prevent recurrences. Also, because the SSDF provides a common language for describing secure software development practices, software producers and acquirers can use it to foster their communications for procurement processes and other management activities.

    title: Proactive Software Supply Chain Risk Management Framework
    version: "1"
    description: The Proactive-Software Supply Chain Risk Management (P-SSCRM) Framework is designed to help you understand and plan a secure software supply chain risk management initiative. P-SSCRM was created through a process of understanding and analyzing real-world data from nine industry-leading software supply chain risk management initiatives as well as through the analysis and unification of ten government and industry documents, frameworks, and standards. Although individual methodologies and standards differ, many initiatives and standards share common ground. P-SSCRM describes this common ground and presents a model for understanding, quantifying, and developing a secure software supply chain risk management program and determining where your organization’s existing efforts stand when contrasted with other real-world software supply chain risk management initiatives.

  title: Access Control
  description: |
    Access Control focuses on the mechanisms and
    policies that control access to the project's version
    control system and CI/CD pipelines. These controls help
    ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive
    data, modify repository settings, or execute build and
    release processes.
  controls:
  - id: OSPS-AC-01
    title: |
      The project's version control system MUST require multi-factor
      authentication for users modifying the project repository
      settings or accessing sensitive data.
    objective: |
      Reduce the risk of account compromise or insider threats by requiring
      multi-factor authentication for collaborators modifying the project
      repository settings or accessing sensitive data.
    assessment-requirements:
    - id: OSPS-AC-01.01
      text: |
        When a user attempts to read or modify a sensitive resource in the project's
        authoritative repository, the system MUST require the user to complete
        a multi-factor authentication process.
      applicability:
      - Maturity Level 1
      - Maturity Level 2
      - Maturity Level 3
      recommendation: |
        Enforce multi-factor authentication for the project's version
        control system, requiring collaborators to provide a second form of
        authentication when accessing sensitive data or modifying repository
        settings. Passkeys are acceptable for this control.

      recommendation: |
        Include a DCO in the project's repository, requiring code
        contributors to assert that they are legally authorized to commit the
        associated contributions on every commit. Use a status check to ensure
        the assertion is made. A CLA also satisfies this requirement.
        Some version control systems, such as GitHub, may include this in the
        platform terms of service.
        
        It is understood that projects with a lengthy history prior to
        adopting OSPS Baseline may not be able to retroactively enforce this
        requirement.

      misused or broken allows them to plan mitigations to close off the potential
      of those threats from occurring.

        When the project has made a release, the project MUST perform a
        security assessment to understand the most likely and impactful
        potential security problems that could occur within the software.
      applicability:
      - Maturity Level 2
      - Maturity Level 3
      recommendation: |
        Performing a security assessment informs both project members as well
        as downstream consumers that the project understands what problems
        could arise within the software. Understanding what threats could be
        realized helps the project manage and address risk. This information
        is useful to downstream consumers to demonstrate the security acumen
        and practices of the project.
        Ensure this is updated for new features or breaking changes.

        When the project has made a release, the project MUST perform a threat
        modeling and attack surface analysis to understand and protect against
        attacks on critical code paths, functions, and interactions within the
        system.
      applicability:
      - Maturity Level 3
      recommendation: |
        Threat modeling is an activity where the project looks at the
        codebase, associated processes and infrastructure, interfaces, key
        components and "thinks like a hacker" and brainstorms how the system
        be be broken or compromised. Each identified threat is listed out so
        the project can then think about how to proactively avoid or close off
        any gaps/vulnerabilities that could arise.
        Ensure this is updated for new features or breaking changes.

      of SCA findings, including vulnerabilities and license issues in software
      dependencies.
      Ensure that violations of your SCA policy are addressed before software
      is merged as well as before it releases, reducing the risk of compromised
      delivery mechanisms or released software assets that are vulnerable or
      malicious.

        While active, the project documentation MUST include a policy that
        defines a threshold for remediation of SCA findings related to
        vulnerabilities and licenses.
      applicability:
      - Maturity Level 3
      recommendation: |
        Document a policy in the project that defines a threshold for
        remediation of SCA findings related to vulnerabilities and licenses.
        Include the process for identifying, prioritizing, and remediating
        these findings.

        While active, the project documentation MUST include a policy to
        address SCA violations prior to any release.
      applicability:
      - Maturity Level 3
      recommendation: |
        Document a policy in the project to address applicable Software
        Composition Analysis results before any release, and add status checks
        that verify compliance with that policy prior to release.

        While active, all changes to the project's codebase MUST be
        automatically evaluated against a documented policy for malicious
        dependencies and known vulnerabilities in dependencies, then blocked
        in the event of violations, except when declared and suppressed as
        non-exploitable.
      applicability:
      - Maturity Level 3
      recommendation: |
        Create a status check in the project's version control system that
        runs a Software Composition Analysis tool on all changes
        to the codebase. Require that the status check passes before changes
        can be merged.
